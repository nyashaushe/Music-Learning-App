Objective: Create a mobile/web application that allows users to learn music by playing and singing from uploaded sheet music.


Features:
Sheet Music Input:

Scan Physical Sheet Music: Use Optical Music Recognition (OMR) to scan and process physical sheet music.

Upload Digital Sheet Music: Allow users to upload digital sheet music in formats like PDF and images.

Music Playback:

Play the entire piece or specific parts (e.g., soprano, tenor, bass).
Control playback speed and loop specific sections for practice.

Singing Instruction:

Highlight notes on the staff that fall within the appropriate vocal range (soprano, tenor, bass).
Visually link highlighted notes on the sheet music to the corresponding sounds during playback.
Provide real-time pitch detection to help users stay in tune.

Timeline:
Phase 1: Core Functionality (1-2 Months)

Research and Choose OMR Libraries:

Evaluate libraries like Tesseract, OpenCV, Audiveris, and OpenSheetMusicDisplay for their capabilities and ease of integration.

Develop Core Functionalities:

Implement sheet music scanning and upload functionality.
Integrate OMR to convert sheet music to a machine-readable format.
Develop basic music playback capabilities using MIDI libraries.

User Interface Design:

Design a user-friendly interface for scanning and uploading sheet music.
Include controls for selecting instruments/voices, playback, and navigation.

Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-3 Months)

Staff Separation:

Develop algorithms to separate musical staves for different voices and instruments.

Voice Selection:
Implement functionality to allow users to choose which staff (instrument/voice) to play.
Enable individual and combined playback of selected voices/instruments.
Singing Instruction:

Integrate vocal range information for different voice parts (soprano, tenor, bass).
Highlight notes on the staff that fall within the chosen vocal range.
Synchronize visual highlighting with corresponding notes during playback.
Implement real-time pitch detection and feedback to assist users in staying in tune.

Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (1 Month)

Beta Testing:

Release the app to a small group of users for feedback and usability testing.

Refine Functionalities:

Based on user feedback, improve core functionalities, address bugs, and enhance user experience.
Optimize performance and ensure the app runs smoothly on various devices.

Resources:
Development Tools:

Mobile app development platforms such as Android Studio and Xcode.
Backend services for storage and processing, if needed (e.g., Firebase, AWS).

Learning Resources:

Online tutorials and documentation for chosen OMR libraries and mobile development platforms.
Resources on music theory and OMR techniques.

Potential Collaborators:

Connect with developers, musicians, and music educators for technical expertise and music theory knowledge.
Engage with user communities to gather feedback and refine the app.


Success Criteria:

Functional OMR and music playback features.
Ability to select and play specific voices/instruments.
User-friendly interface for learning to sing from sheet music.
Positive feedback from beta testers, indicating ease of use and effectiveness in learning music.
